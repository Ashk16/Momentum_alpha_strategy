# Project Document: Automated BSE Announcement Trading System

**Project Code Name:** "Momentum Alpha"

---

## 1. Executive Summary

Project "Momentum Alpha" is a sophisticated, automated trading system designed to capitalize on short-term market inefficiencies following specific corporate announcements on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE).

The system will continuously monitor the BSE website for new circulars, use a Natural Language Processing (NLP) engine to identify high-impact announcements (specifically "Award of Order"), and extract key data points like company name and order value.

Based on a historical analysis of stock performance following similar events, the system will automatically calculate an optimal target and trailing stop-loss. It will then connect to a brokerage API to execute a buy order instantly, aiming to capture the initial price momentum while strictly managing risk.

## 2. Project Goals & Scope

### 2.1 Goals

- **Primary Goal:** To develop a fully automated, end-to-end system that can profitably trade specific, news-driven market events.
- **Secondary Goal:** To create a robust backtesting engine to analyze and refine the trading strategy based on historical data.
- **Success Metric:** Achieve a consistently positive return on investment (ROI) over a 6-month period, with a Sharpe Ratio greater than 1.5.

### 2.2 In-Scope

- Development of an ethical web scraper for the BSE corporate announcements page
- An NLP module to parse announcement titles and identify "Award of Order" events
- A quantitative analysis module to determine dynamic target and stop-loss levels
- Integration with a single, specified brokerage API for order placement
- Real-time logging of all actions, trades, and performance metrics
- Backtesting capabilities on historical announcement data

### 2.3 Out-of-Scope

- Trading based on any other type of announcement (e.g., quarterly results, mergers)
- Fundamental or technical analysis beyond the scope of the event-driven strategy
- Trading on any exchange other than the BSE
- Manual trading intervention through the system's interface
- Support for multiple brokerage accounts simultaneously

## 3. System Architecture & Components

The system will be built with a modular architecture, allowing for independent development and testing of each component.

### Module 1: Data Ingestion Engine (The "Scraper")

**Function:** Continuously monitor https://www.bseindia.com/corporates/ann.html for new announcements.

**Methodology:**
- Perform a "diff" check on the page content at a set interval (e.g., every 15 seconds)
- **Ethical Scraping:**
  - Adhere strictly to BSE's robots.txt file
  - Use a clear User-Agent string to identify the bot
  - Implement a polite polling interval to avoid overloading BSE servers
- Upon detecting a new announcement, it will download the title and the PDF link

### Module 2: NLP & Filtering Engine (The "Brain")

**Function:** To read the announcement title and decide if it's a tradable event.

**Methodology:**
- **Keyword Filtering:** Scan titles for primary keywords like "Award of Order", "Receives Order", "Secures Contract"
- **Named Entity Recognition (NER):** If a keyword is found, the engine will attempt to extract key entities:
  - **Company Name/Symbol:** To identify the stock
  - **Order Value (Amount):** To gauge the significance of the order (e.g., "Rs. 500 Crore"). This helps in filtering out minor, insignificant orders

### Module 3: Historical Analysis & Strategy Engine (The "Strategist")

**Function:** To calculate the trade parameters (Target Price, Stop-Loss).

**Methodology:**
- Upon receiving a valid trade signal from the NLP Engine, this module accesses a historical database of similar announcements
- It analyzes the price action of the stock (and similar stocks in the same sector) for the X days following past "Award of Order" announcements
- It calculates the average percentage gain, the time taken to reach the peak, and the average volatility
- **Dynamic Target:** Sets a target price slightly below the historical average peak (e.g., if the average peak is 9%, set the target at 8% to ensure a higher probability of execution)
- **Dynamic Stop-Loss:** Calculates a trailing stop-loss based on the stock's recent Average True Range (ATR) or volatility, making it wide enough to avoid being triggered by normal price fluctuations

### Module 4: Trade Execution & Risk Management (The "Executor")

**Function:** To place and manage the live trade.

**Methodology:**
- Connects to the brokerage API (e.g., Zerodha Kite Connect, Fyers API)
- **Pre-Trade Checks:** Before placing an order, it will perform critical checks:
  - Is the stock currently hitting an upper/lower circuit?
  - Is there sufficient liquidity in the order book?
  - Does the order size comply with our predefined risk per trade?
- **Order Placement:** Places a Bracket Order (BO) or Cover Order (CO) which includes the buy order, target price, and trailing stop-loss in a single command. This is a crucial risk management feature.

## 4. Key Considerations & Risk Factors

### Critical Risk Factors to Address:

- **Slippage:** The price can change in the milliseconds between your system detecting the news and the order being placed on the exchange. This can affect your entry price.

- **Liquidity Risk:** For smaller stocks, a sudden rush of buy orders can drive the price up instantly. Your order might only be partially filled, or filled at a much higher price than anticipated.

- **False Positives:** The NLP engine might misinterpret a title. For example, "Board Meeting to consider Award of Order..." is not the same as an actual award. The logic must be precise.

- **Market-Wide Events:** A major market crash (a "black swan" event) will override any positive news for a single stock. The system needs a "master kill switch" or logic to halt trading during extreme market volatility (e.g., if India VIX spikes above a certain level).

- **API Downtime:** Your broker's API could go down, or the BSE website could be unavailable, causing the system to miss trades or be unable to manage open positions.

- **Data Quality:** Historical price data or announcement data could be inaccurate, leading to flawed backtesting and strategy calculation.
